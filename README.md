## What it does

Toppings is a powerful browser extension that adds an extra layer of flavor for a more efficient and convenient web. Developed by Enrych Platforms, Toppings offers a range of customizable features and convenient tools to make your web time more enjoyable and efficient. Toppings was created by avid web users who understand the need for additional functionality and customization options. We recognized that certain features were missing from the default web experience, so we decided to develop Toppings to fill that gap. Our mission is to empower users like you to have greater control over your web experience and make your time spent on the platform more enjoyable.
