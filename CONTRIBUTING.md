- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

1. **Create an Issue**: Before creating a new issue, please check if a similar issue already exists. If it does, you can join the discussion there. If not, feel free to create a new issue. We encourage you to provide clear and concise details about the bug or feature you want to address. This ensures that your work aligns with the project's goals and prevents duplication of effort.

2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository to create your copy.

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

4. **Make Changes**: Make your changes in the new branch. Be sure to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines. Make sure that the code is linted.

5. **Test your Changes**: Verify that your changes work as expected in the extension by interacting with it in your browser.

6. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "Add a new feature"
```

7. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Open a PR from your forked repository to the original repository. Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.

9. **Code Review**: Participate in the code review process. Address any feedback or comments.

10. **Merge**: Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main project.

11. **Celebrate**: Your contribution is now part of the project! üéâ

## üìÆ Submitting PRs

All PRs should be against `main`, and ideally should address an open issue, unless the change is small. Direct commits to main are blocked, and PRs require an approving review to merge into main. By convention, the Toppings maintainers will review PRs when:

- An initial review has been requested
- A clear, descriptive title has been assigned to the PR
- A maintainer is tagged in the PR comments and asked to complete a review

Don't forget the format your code before pushing:
