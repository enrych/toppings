### Looping Video Segments (New in v2.2.0)

Weâ€™re excited to announce the addition of a powerful new feature in Toppings v2.2.0 â€“ the ability to **loop specific segments** of YouTube videos! Whether you're practicing dance moves, learning an instrument, or simply repeating your favorite moments, you can now loop portions of a video effortlessly. ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ¶

To use this feature:
- Start by pressing the **'Z' key** to set loop markers at your desired start and end points in the video.
- Press **'Z'** again to toggle the loop on and off.

This makes it easy to focus on specific parts of the video without needing to constantly rewind or fast-forward. Enjoy mastering your content with precise control!
